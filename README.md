# HLWT

A new version of my old basicSynth VST but remade and sounds better currently


## Requirements


- [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

Doesn't really matter which you go with.

- [JUCE Framework](https://juce.com/)

- A DAW for testing [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) should work fine it's free too

## Known Issues
- Current version 0.0.1 has a problem with the midi function where it sticks on a note even if a key is being pressed.
- The more notes you add the louder it gets.

## Demos (Will be updated as I make progress.)
