# HLWT

A new version of my old basicSynth VST but remade and sounds better currently


## Requirements


- [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

Doesn't really matter which you go with.

- [JUCE Framework](https://juce.com/)

- A DAW for testing [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) should work fine it's free too

### Demos (Will be updated as I make progress.)
